Used as a guide-post/directional tool to prompt Kanban tasks. These broad tasks are milestones; made up of smaller more specific Kanban tasks.

As a user:

- I want to be able to view a page with the details of my pet including name, bio (and stats - stretch)
- I want to be able to change the name and bio of my pet.
- I want to be able to register as a user so it saves my pet.

Stretch:
- I want to be able to see a list of all users and their leaderboard score.
- I want to be able to search users.
- I want to be able to join a 'guild' - Team's Red/Yellow/Green and Blue, with its own chatroom.
- I want to be able to select my pets class (which effects their stats).
- I want to be able to train to upgrade my pets stats.
- I want to be able to chat with other players regardless of team.
